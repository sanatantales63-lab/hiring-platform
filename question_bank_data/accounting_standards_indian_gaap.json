"question": "During year-end close, the statutory audit committee asks whether the note on significant accounting policies should disclose the method used to classify a one-off insurance recovery. Under AS 1, how should the company proceed for audit disclosure?",
"options": [
"A) Disclose the nature of the one-off insurance recovery and the accounting policy used to recognise it in the significant accounting policies note.",
"B) Omit disclosure because one-off items need not be included in AS 1 policies.",
"C) Only disclose the amount in the financial statements without describing the accounting policy.",
"D) Disclose the item as extraordinary in a separate schedule outside AS 1 requirements."
],
"correctAnswer": "A) Disclose the nature of the one-off insurance recovery and the accounting policy used to recognise it in the significant accounting policies note.",
"explanation": "AS 1 requires disclosure of significant accounting policies and material items; the nature and policy for one-off recoveries is material.\nAuditors expect the note to explain recognition criteria so users can understand comparability and basis of presentation."

"options": [
"A) Continue FIFO for all inventories to avoid disclosure complexity.",
"B) Disclose the basis of valuation for each class of inventory and justify the change for the slow-moving line in the notes.",
"C) Aggregate inventory values and disclose only the total amount to simplify reporting.",

],
"correctAnswer": "B) Disclose the basis of valuation for each class of inventory and justify the change for the slow-moving line in the notes.",

],
"correctAnswer": "C) Recognise revenue over the period of providing services consistent with AS 9 revenue recognition criteria.",

"question": "At the pre-audit board meeting, management suggests treating the going concern uncertainty due to a major customer loss as a disclosure only, not adjusting asset valuations. Under fundamental accounting assumptions how should auditors advise the board?",
"options": [
"A) Maintain current carrying values and add a brief disclosure only, since uncertainty alone does not require adjustments.",
"B) Revise all comparative numbers to reflect hypothetical liquidation values.",
"C) Assess whether material uncertainty requires modification of going concern assumption and adjust asset valuations if going concern is no longer appropriate.",
"D) Defer any decision to next year as going concern is a management judgment."
],
"correctAnswer": "D) Defer any decision to next year as going concern is a management judgment.",
"explanation": "Incorrect — going concern is a critical assumption; auditors must evaluate evidence and may require adjustments if viability is doubtful.\nIf uncertainty is material, assets should be tested for impairment and disclosures expanded rather than mere deferral."

"options": [
"A) The company can selectively apply cash basis for certain contracts without disclosure.",
"B) Fundamental assumption of accrual requires revenue recognition when earned; change to cash basis requires justification and disclosure under AS 1.",
"C) Use cash basis for revenue and accrual for expenses to optimize tax outcomes.",
"D) No accounting standard governs basis selection; choose what suits stakeholders."
],
"correctAnswer": "B) Fundamental assumption of accrual requires revenue recognition when earned; change to cash basis requires justification and disclosure under AS 1.",
"explanation": "The accrual assumption is a core accounting principle; any change in basis materially affecting results must be justified and disclosed.\nAuditors will require disclosure of the change and assess whether it complies with AS 1 on significant accounting policies."

"C) Capitalise all costs to comply with prudence principle.",
"D) Reclassify handling costs as administrative expenses to be conservative."
],
"correctAnswer": "C) Capitalise all costs to comply with prudence principle.",

"D) Revaluation is prohibited for land; carry at historical cost only."
],
"correctAnswer": "A) Revaluation surplus can be credited to general reserves without specific disclosure.",

"C) Capitalise as intangible asset under AS 26 without further assessment.",
"D) Defer recognition until training results in measurable cost savings."
],
"correctAnswer": "B) Expense training costs as they do not meet recognition criteria for PPE and are covered by AS 15 as employee benefit expense.",
