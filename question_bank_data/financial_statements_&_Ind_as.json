    "explanation": "Under Schedule III Division II, Lease Liabilities recognised under Ind-AS 116 are classified under 'Borrowings' (long-term or current based on maturity), not under Provisions. Provisions are for obligations of uncertain timing or amount, which a lease liability is not."

    "question": "MegaAssets Ltd. is testing a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) for impairment. The carrying amount of the CGU is ₹500 lakhs, including goodwill of ₹80 lakhs. The Value in Use is ₹420 lakhs, and the Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal is ₹440 lakhs. Under Ind-AS 36, what is the impairment loss and how should it be allocated?",
    "options": [
      "A) Impairment loss = ₹80 lakhs; allocated entirely to goodwill as carrying amount exceeds VIU",
      "B) Impairment loss = ₹60 lakhs; allocated proportionately across all assets in the CGU including goodwill",
      "C) No impairment loss; the FVLCD of ₹440L approximates the carrying amount of ₹500L within a 10% threshold",
      "D) Impairment loss = ₹60 lakhs; allocated first entirely to goodwill (since ₹60L does not exceed goodwill of ₹80L), with no allocation to other assets"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "D) Impairment loss = ₹60 lakhs; allocated first entirely to goodwill (since ₹60L does not exceed goodwill of ₹80L), with no allocation to other assets",
    "explanation": "Recoverable Amount = higher of VIU (₹420L) and FVLCD (₹440L) = ₹440L. Impairment loss = ₹500L − ₹440L = ₹60L. Per Ind-AS 36 para 104, impairment is first allocated to reduce goodwill; since ₹60L < ₹80L goodwill, other assets are unaffected."

    "question": "Sunrise Logistics Ltd. (lessee) enters a 4-year equipment lease with payments of ₹10 lakhs payable at the start of each year (annuity in advance). The IBR is 8% p.a. The PV annuity-due factor (4 years, 8%) = 3.5771. At year-end, the company records only a ₹10 lakh debit to the lease liability with no interest expense. Identify the error and state the correct Ind-AS 116 treatment for Year 1.",
    "options": [
      "A) No error; since payments are in advance, no interest accrues in the first year",
      "B) The lease liability at inception is ₹35.77L; after the Day 1 payment the outstanding balance is ₹25.77L; interest for Year 1 = ₹25.77L × 8% = ₹2.06L must be accrued and reflected in the income statement",
      "C) Advance lease payments must be treated as prepaid rent and are not part of the lease liability calculation under Ind-AS 116",
      "D) Interest accrues only from Year 2 onward for annuity-due arrangements since the first payment precedes any interest accrual period"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "B) The lease liability at inception is ₹35.77L; after the Day 1 payment the outstanding balance is ₹25.77L; interest for Year 1 = ₹25.77L × 8% = ₹2.06L must be accrued and reflected in the income statement",
    "explanation": "Under Ind-AS 116, lease liability = ₹10L × 3.5771 = ₹35.77L. The first payment reduces it to ₹25.77L on Day 1. Interest for Year 1 accrues on ₹25.77L at 8% = ₹2.06L. Omitting this interest understates finance costs and overstates profit."

    "question": "Nova Tech Ltd. creates a warranty provision of ₹40 lakhs (deductible for tax only when actually paid). Tax rate = 30%. The company also records a revaluation surplus of ₹50 lakhs in OCI on freehold land measured at fair value (taxable only on eventual sale). Identify the correct deferred tax accounting under Ind-AS 12.",
    "options": [
      "A) Recognise a Deferred Tax Asset of ₹12 lakhs on the warranty provision (in P&L) and a Deferred Tax Liability of ₹15 lakhs on the revaluation surplus (recognised in OCI, not P&L)",
      "B) Recognise only a DTA of ₹12 lakhs; revaluation of freehold land does not give rise to deferred tax as land is not depreciable",
      "C) Recognise only a DTL of ₹15 lakhs on revaluation; warranty DTA cannot be recognised without virtual certainty of future taxable profits",
      "D) Recognise both DTA ₹12 lakhs and DTL ₹15 lakhs, but route both through the P&L as they arise from book-to-tax differences"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "A) Recognise a Deferred Tax Asset of ₹12 lakhs on the warranty provision (in P&L) and a Deferred Tax Liability of ₹15 lakhs on the revaluation surplus (recognised in OCI, not P&L)",
    "explanation": "Under Ind-AS 12, DTA on deductible temporary difference (warranty ₹40L × 30% = ₹12L) is recognised in P&L. For revaluation surplus on land, Ind-AS 12 para 20 requires recognition of DTL (₹50L × 30% = ₹15L) in OCI to match the item that created it, not in P&L."

    "question": "Orbit Constructions Ltd. signs a ₹5 crore fixed-price contract to build a residential complex. The contract includes a performance bonus of ₹50 lakhs if completion occurs before 18 months. Based on historical project data, management estimates a 40% probability of earning the bonus. At contract inception, how should the variable consideration be included in the transaction price under Ind-AS 115?",
    "options": [
      "A) Include the full ₹50 lakhs in the transaction price as it is contractually agreed upon",
      "B) Exclude the ₹50 lakhs entirely until the project is completed and the bonus is formally confirmed",
      "C) Include ₹20 lakhs (expected value: 40% × ₹50L) in the transaction price only to the extent it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty resolves",
      "D) Include ₹50 lakhs only after the 18-month milestone is crossed and the outcome is no longer uncertain"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "C) Include ₹20 lakhs (expected value: 40% × ₹50L) in the transaction price only to the extent it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty resolves",
    "explanation": "Under Ind-AS 115 Step 2, variable consideration is estimated using either the expected value or most likely amount method and constrained to amounts where a significant revenue reversal is highly improbable. Here, expected value = ₹20L, which may be included subject to the constraint test being satisfied."
