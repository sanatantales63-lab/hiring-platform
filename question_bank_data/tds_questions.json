    "correctAnswer": "D) Both B and C",

    "correctAnswer": "B) Rely on judicial precedents and CBDT circulars clarifying that standard cloud/SaaS subscriptions are not 'fees for technical services' as there is no human element involved (make available clause under DTAA)",
    "explanation": "Multiple tribunals have held that standardized cloud/SaaS services do not qualify as 'technical services' under Section 194J since no technical know-how is 'made available' to the payer; these are treated as business income not taxable in India if the provider has no PE."

    "explanation": "TDS is triggered on credit or payment, whichever is earlier. However, CBDT and various courts have accepted that if a provision is reversed before the due date of the TDS return without any actual payment, it reflects non-crystallization of the expense and TDS need not be deducted."
