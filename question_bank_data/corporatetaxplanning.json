"question": "The board of a newly incorporated domestic manufacturing company (turnover nil in prior year) is deciding whether to opt for Section 115BAA (22% concessional tax) from the first year. The CFO notes the company expects to claim various deductions (investment allowance, export incentives) over the next 5 years. Which board-level decision is most tax-efficient at incorporation?",
"options": [
"A) Opt for Section 115BAA immediately to lock in 22% tax and forfeit most specified deductions.",
"B) Avoid 115BAA in the first year and claim deductions, then opt later when deductions are exhausted.",
"C) Opt for 115BAA but apply for rollover of investment allowance to the next year.",
"D) Do not opt for 115BAA and instead choose Section 115BAB for manufacturing startups for lower rate."
],
"correctAnswer": "A) Opt for Section 115BAA immediately to lock in 22% tax and forfeit most specified deductions.",
"explanation": "Choosing 115BAA fixes tax at ~22% and requires forfeiture of certain deductions, often beneficial if effective tax under old regime exceeds 22%.\nIf the board expects limited long-term deductions, locking 115BAA at incorporation is typically efficient."
