    "explanation": "With Standard Price (S) control, inventory is always valued at the standard price. Any difference between PO price and invoice price is posted to a Price Difference account.

    "correctAnswer": "B) Run FAGL_FC_VAL selecting the 'Valuate G/L Account Balances' option for balance sheet accounts",

F.05 is the legacy classic G/L equivalent and is not recommended in New G/L environments."
