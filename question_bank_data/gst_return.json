    "options": ["A) No late fees, as turnover is below ₹1.5 crore", "B) Late fees under Section 47 of CGST Act, ₹50/day (₹25 CGST + ₹25 SGST)", "C) Late fees under Section 50, calculated as interest on tax liability", "D) Late fees of ₹200/day since outward supplies are involved"],
    "correctAnswer": "B) Late fees under Section 47 of CGST Act, ₹50/day (₹25 CGST + ₹25 SGST)",
    "explanation": "Section 47 levies late fees of ₹50/day (₹25 each under CGST & SGST) for delayed GSTR-1 filing, subject to a maximum cap. Turnover threshold affects filing frequency, not the late fee provision."

    "options": ["A) It can be claimed only by filing a revised GSTR-3B for October 2024", "B) It can be claimed in GSTR-3B up to November 30, 2025 (before annual return filing date)", "C) It can be claimed in any subsequent GSTR-3B up to 30th November 2025 or the due date of annual return for FY 2024-25, whichever is earlier", "D) The ITC lapses since it was not claimed in the same month as GSTR-2B generation"],
    "correctAnswer": "C) It can be claimed in any subsequent GSTR-3B up to 30th November 2025 or the due date of annual return for FY 2024-25, whichever is earlier",

Under which rule should the exporter primarily build their defence?",

    "correctAnswer": "C) ₹1.20 lakh + ₹1.584 lakh (18% of remaining ₹8.8 lakh common credit) = ₹2.784 lakh",
    "explanation": "Rule 42 requires first separating direct exempt-use ITC (₹1.2L), then applying the exempt turnover ratio (18%) on remaining common ITC (₹8.8L = ₹1.584L). Both are reversed together as the total ineligible ITC."
