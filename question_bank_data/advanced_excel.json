    "question": "You are an accounts assistant entering invoice data. Cell B2 contains the unit price ₹500 and cell C2 contains quantity 10. You copy the formula =B2*C2 from D2 down to D3, but D3 shows 0 because B3 and C3 are empty. Your manager wants the unit price to always refer to B2 regardless of which row the formula is in. Which formula in D2 should you use before copying it down?",
    "options": ["A) =B2*C2", "B) =$B$2*C2", "C) =B$2*$C2", "D) =$B2*C$2"],
    "correctAnswer": "B) =$B$2*C2",
    "explanation": "$B$2 locks the unit price cell absolutely so it never changes when the formula is copied down. C2 remains relative so it adjusts to the correct quantity row as you copy the formula downward."

Your manager wants a professional look with the Indian Rupee symbol and two decimal places. Without changing the actual cell values, which is the fastest way to apply this formatting to C2:C500?",
    "options": ["A) Type the ₹ symbol manually before each number", "B) Select C2:C500 → Right-click → Format Cells → Number → Currency → select ₹ symbol with 2 decimal places", "C) Use a formula =TEXT(C2,\"₹#,##0.00\") in a helper column", "D) Use Find & Replace to add ₹ before every number"],
    "correctAnswer": "B) Select C2:C500 → Right-click → Format Cells → Number → Currency → select ₹ symbol with 2 decimal places",
    "explanation": "Format Cells → Currency applies the display format instantly across all selected cells without altering underlying values. Using TEXT() (option C) converts numbers to text strings, breaking any downstream SUM formulas."

    "options": ["A) Apply each format separately using the Home ribbon buttons one at a time", "B) Select row 51 → Format Cells (Ctrl+1) → apply Font: Bold, White; Fill: Dark Blue in one dialog", "C) Use Conditional Formatting to highlight the totals row", "D) Copy formatting from a pre-formatted template cell using Format Painter"],
    "correctAnswer": "B) Select row 51 → Format Cells (Ctrl+1) → apply Font: Bold, White; Fill: Dark Blue in one dialog",

    "correctAnswer": "B) One or more cells in the Date column in the source data contain text values or blanks instead of valid date serial numbers",

    "options": ["A) The range should be DebtorMaster!A:C — column D is out of range", "B) The col_index_num should be 4 instead of 3 to return the Credit Limit from column D", "C) FALSE should be changed to TRUE for an exact match on IDs", "D) The lookup should use INDEX-MATCH since VLOOKUP cannot skip columns"],
    "correctAnswer": "B) The col_index_num should be 4 instead of 3 to return the Credit Limit from column D",
    "explanation": "In VLOOKUP, the col_index_num counts from the first column of the lookup range. Column D is the 4th column in A:D, so index 4 returns the Credit Limit. Index 3 correctly returns City (column C), confirming the colleague's formula has the wrong index."
